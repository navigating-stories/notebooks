    "# Multilingual Digital Story Grammar\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we aim to implement a version of Digital Story Grammar (DSG; Bastholm Andrade & Andersen; [link](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13645579.2020.1723205)) that works with multiple languages (in particular Dutch, German, Danish, and English). The code will interface to the spaCy NLP library that has pretrained and easy-to-use pipelines for many languages available.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the method is to extract the subject (actor), main verb (action), and object of each sentence or phrase. In DSG, these are referenced as *narrative units* and enable the construction of character networks. This notebook will use spaCy's `DependencyMatcher` to extract patterns in dependency relations of each sentence. However, each language has somewhat different dependency relations so it requires a specific set of patterns to be matched. German in particular uses a completely different notation for dependency relations, so it requires entirely different patterns that the other three languages (see this [link](https://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/documents/ressourcen/korpora/tiger-corpus/annotation/tiger_scheme-syntax.pdf) for the notation scheme). \n",
    "\n",
    "The patterns for each language are store in a separate `multilingual_dsg_patterns_xx.json` file. The pattern files consist of a nested list of dictionaries `[[{}, {}, ...], ...]`. Each list of dictionaries `[{},{}, ...]` represents a pattern of dependency relations that will be matched. Each dictionary in the list represents a token that is part of the dependency relations pattern. The first dictionary in each pattern has usually two entries: `RIGHT_ID` indicating a name for the token in the pattern; and `RIGHT_ATTRS` listing the required attributes of the token for a match (e.g., `{\"DEP\": \"nsubj\"}` means that the token must be a subject in a phrase). There can be `OR` or `NOT` type matches by using `IN` or `NOT_IN` keys for dictionaries (see the pattern files for examples). Subsequent dictionaries in a pattern have two additional entries: `LEFT_ID` which refers to another token in the parsing tree to which the current token is related; and `REL_OP` specifying the relation between the other token and the token to be matched. An overview of possible relations is presented on https://spacy.io/api/dependencymatcher. For example `REL_OP: >` indicates a match when the `LEFT_ID` token is the head of the `RIGHT_ID` token in the parsing tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "A sentence or phrase can have multiple matches for a pattern (i.e., multiple objects or conjuncts), and for each match a row is added to the output table.\n",
    "\n",
    "A step-by-step example can also be found on https://spacy.io/api/dependencymatcher."
